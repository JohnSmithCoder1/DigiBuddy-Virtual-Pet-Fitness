Meet DigiBuddy—the walking and workout game that turns your daily activity into care for your buddy. Every step, run, or exercise session helps your digi grow stronger and happier, while you build habits that last.

Instead of a tracker that just counts steps, DigiBuddy makes your health journey engaging, accountable, and fun.

Why DigiBuddy works:
* **A Fitness Buddy Who Depends on You** – Your virtual pet thrives when you move, giving you instant motivation to stay active.
* **Gamified Habits That Stick** – Walking, running, and workouts turn into streaks, milestones, and celebrations.
* **Daily Goals Made Personal** – Set step and exercise targets that fit your lifestyle—not someone else’s.
* **Accountability Made Simple** – See progress summaries, earn rewards, and keep your streaks alive.
* **Seamless Apple Health Sync** – Automatically track activity from your iPhone or Apple Watch.
* **Balanced Self-Care** – Pause streaks when life gets busy so healthy habits stay positive, not stressful.

With DigiBuddy, your activity isn’t just exercise—it’s care for your buddy, pride in your streaks, and a playful push toward healthier routines.
